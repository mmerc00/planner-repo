Tiffany Lombardi, Michael Habert, James Kim, Nathan Paecchi and Cammeryne Sullivan collaborated

we first added blocks to the HTML with the help of Michael

we then created dependencies and variables which we then used in functions

to get the cuurent date we found a my date function that is vanilla javascript

time object was created in military time because its repeatable

Worked with Justin who provided neccesary code that would color assign the text blocks

store user input

didn't touch style css sheet
